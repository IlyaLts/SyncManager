# Introduction

**SyncManager** is a custom-made lightweight synchronization manager for personal use that helps you synchronize your files and folders across different folders. Sync Manager lets you sync your data in two ways: manually or automatically. Manual syncing mode lets you decide what and when to sync data, while automatic syncing mode syncs data based on the time elapsed since the previous synchronization. You can also decide how to handle old versions of files and folders: move them to the trash, delete them permanently, or version them in a special folder. The utility is mostly designed to run in the system tray, but it can also work without any system tray interactions. Written using Qt Framework for Windows/Linux.
